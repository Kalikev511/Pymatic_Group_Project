    "    - **Correctness (40%)**: The code should function as intended, producing accurate outputs.\n",
    "    - **Readability (30%)**: Code readability is essential for collaborative work in professional environments. This includes clear and consistent naming conventions for variables and functions, as well as adequate but not too lengthy commenting (pseudocodes) to explain complex logic.\n",
    "    - **Conciseness (20%)**: While readable, codes should also be concise, avoiding unnecessary complexity or redundancy. For instance, repetitive codes can be avoided by defining functions, using walrus operator, or conditional expression, list/dictionary comprehensions, etc."

    "- **Task Description**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Develop a Python program that simulates taking orders at a café. The program will allow customers to order coffee, snacks, and beverages, take note of special requests, and calculate the total cost, including an optional tip. The system will provide a detailed receipt.\n",
    "    - The task is decomposed into the following subtasks:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - 1. Prompt the customer to input their name and display a personalized welcome message using an f-string.\n",
    "        - 2. Provide a predefined menu of coffee, snacks, and beverages with their respective prices.\n",
    "        - 3. Continuously ask the customer for their order until they indicate they are done.\n",
    "        - 4. Allow customers to order multiple quantities of the same item.\n",
    "        - 5. Account for invalid inputs (e.g., item not on the menu or incorrect quantity).\n",
    "        - 6. Prompt the customer to add special requests (e.g., \"extra cream,\" \"no sugar\") for their coffee or beverages.\n",
    "        - 7. Use a dictionary to store the order, including item names, quantities, special requests, and total prices.\n",
    "        - 8. Calculate the total cost, including an optional tip (e.g., prompt the customer for a tip percentage).\n",
    "        - 9. Print a detailed receipt showing each item, its quantity, special requests, and price.\n",
    "        - 10. Include the subtotal, tip amount (if applicable), and the grand total.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Please include reasonable pseudocodes and clearly comment which concepts covered in the class you have used to develop your program."
