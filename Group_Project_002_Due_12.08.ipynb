    "    - **Correctness (40%)**: The code should function as intended, producing accurate outputs.\n",
    "    - **Readability (30%)**: Code readability is essential for collaborative work in professional environments. This includes clear and consistent naming conventions for variables and functions, as well as adequate but not too lengthy commenting (pseudocodes) to explain complex logic.\n",
    "    - **Conciseness (30%)**: While readable, codes should also be concise, avoiding unnecessary complexity or redundancy. For instance, repetitive codes can be avoided by defining functions, using walrus operator, or conditional expression, list/dictionary comprehensions, etc."

    "- **Task Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Develop a Python program to read and analyze a text file named 'Preventing Ransomware Attacks at Scale.txt'. The program will extract and analyze words based on specific criteria, such as identifying frequent terms related to cybersecurity concepts and vulnerabilities.\n",
    "    - The task is decomposed into the following subtasks:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - 1. Use Python's file handling methods to ```open and read``` the contents of 'Preventing Ransomware Attacks at Scale.txt'.\n",
    "        - 2. Try your best to clean each line by, e.g., removing punctuations, and split it into individual words. Please handle case sensitivity, e.g., treat 'Word' and 'word' as the same word. The use of the ```string``` module is permitted. \n",
    "               \n",
    "        - 3. ```Iterate``` over the list of words.\n",
    "              - Extract and count the frequency of words that end with specific cybersecurity-related suffixes, such as:\n",
    "              \n",
    "                   -'tion' (e.g., \"implementation\", \"prevention\").\n",
    "                   \n",
    "                   -'ing' (e.g., \"attacking\", \"defending\").\n",
    "                   \n",
    "                   -'ity' (e.g., \"security\", \"complexity\").\n",
    "\n",
    "        - 4. Store and Sort Data\n",
    "               - Store the words ending with the specified suffix in separate dictionaries, with the word as the key and its frequency as the value.\n",
    "               - Convert each dictionary into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a frequency count and the corresponding word.\n",
    "               - Sort the lists in descending order of frequency using the sort() method.\n",
    "        - 5. Get the Top 10 Words for each suffix.\n",
    "             \n",
    "        - 6. Present the top 10 words for each suffix, using f-strings for formatting the results neatly. \n",
    "             \n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Please include reasonable pseudocodes and clearly comment which concepts covered in the class you have used to develop your program."
